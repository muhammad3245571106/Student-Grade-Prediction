# Student-Grade-Prediction
<b>Problem:</b> To predict students’ grade as “pass” or “fail” before: (a) Mid-II, and, (b) Final exams. 
For Mid-II grade prediction, use the following features: first four assignments, first four quizzes 
and Mid-I scores; and, for grade prediction before final exam, use all the features (take best 5 
assignments and quizzes).<br>
<b>Objectives:</b> To answer the following two research questions.
* RQ-1: How accurately can we predict students’ grades before the Mid-II exam?
* RQ-2: How accurately can we predict students’ grades before Final exam?
<br>
<b>Dataset:</b> The dataset contains students’ assessment scores including <Assignments, Quizzes, Mid-I, Mid-II>, and a predictor variable <Grade>. The data has been anonymized to hide identities of 
the students and course(s). The data is shared on seven sheets (D1 to D7), where each sheet 
contains a different number of assignments and quizzes. However, only the best 5 assignments and 
quizzes are included for each student before calculating their grades. Also note that total marks for 
assignments and quizzes are given on the top along their corresponding weights.
## Project Phase-I
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the given dataset for 
understanding and preprocessing the data that might help you in the second 
phase of the project.
## Project Phase-II
Model training and results reporting using the three classifiers (Nearest
neighbor, Decision tree)
## Expected outputs:
### Phase-I
* Report data analyses that you performed through charts/tables.
* Report issue(s) that you identified and the corrective measure taken in pre-processing phase.
* Paste screenshots if a tool is used, submit the code otherwise.
### Phase-II
* Details of data preprocessing steps (if performed).
* Model’s baseline accuracy.
* Results reporting: confusion matrix, performance evaluation metrics(accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, etc.), tables and/or charts.
